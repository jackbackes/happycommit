# Welcome to HappyCommit! ðŸ˜Š 

HappyCommit is a delightful tool that harnesses the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo language model to generate meaningful and descriptive Git commit messages for you. With HappyCommit, you can now focus on writing great code while we take care of crafting the perfect commit messages.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your macOS system.

## Getting Started (macOS)

1. To begin your journey with HappyCommit, install it by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   brew tap jackbackes/git-commit-gpt
   brew install jackbackes/homebrew-git-commit-gpt/git-commit-gpt.rb
   ```

2. After the installation, let's add your OpenAI API key to the configuration file. Simply run the following command and enter your API key when prompted:

   ```bash
   printf "Enter your OPENAI_API_KEY: " && read -rs api_key && mkdir ~/.happycommit >> /dev/null && echo "OPENAI_API_KEY = \\\"$api_key\\\"" >> ~/.happycommit/config.toml
   ```

   Don't have an OpenAI API key yet? No worries! Grab one from your [OpenAI account](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).

3. That's it! HappyCommit is now ready to make your Git experience more enjoyable. Just use the `git commit-gpt` command to generate and add a commit message based on your code changes.
